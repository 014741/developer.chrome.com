description: How to internationalize your Chrome Web Store extension.
---

This page describes how to support multiple languages of an extension or theme ("item") in the Chrome Web Store.

Unless your extension is strictly local in scope, you should _internationalize_ it, making it easy to
adapt to various languages and regions. You can then _localize_ itâ€”translate and otherwise adapt it
so that it works well in a particular locale.

{% Aside %}
The word _internationalization_ is often abbreviated to _i18n_, referring to the 18
letters between the letters _i_ and _n_. _Localization_ is sometimes abbreviated to _l10n_.
{% endAside %}

## Overview

You can follow these steps to internationalize and localize an extension to be published
in the Chrome Web Store:

1. Decide which [locales][supported-locales] you want to support.
1. Internationalize and localize the extension's UI using the [extension system i18n support][i18n].
1. Localize your extension's [name and description][manifest].
1. [Upload your extension][publish] using the Chrome Developer Dashboard.
1. Edit your listing, providing localized versions of the [detailed description][cws-description], a YouTube video URL and [screenshots][cws-screenshots].
1. Specify which [regions][regions] you want to support.

{% Aside %}
You can significantly **increase your extension's ranking** in the locales that you support by
localizing the name, description, and detailed description.
{% endAside %}

## Localizing your extension listing

To localize your extension's listing, you first localize the name and description. Then, after uploading
your localized extension, you can edit your extension's listing to specify localized versions of your extension's
detailed description and screenshots.

### Name and description {: #localize-manifest }

You localize the name and description by modifying `manifest.json` and providing a `_locales`
directory in your extension's ZIP file. Specifically, you need to:

- Modify the "name" and "description" manifest fields
- Add a "default_locale" field
- Provide at least one `_locales/_locale_/messages.json` file, where _`locale`_ is a [locale
  code][supported-locales]; each `messages.json` file contains the strings for one locale

Here's an example of how you might specify the name and description of an internationalized hosted
extension that has English as its default language and British English as its secondary language:

```json
//in manifest.json:
  "name": "__MSG_appName__",
  "description": "__MSG_appDesc__",
  "default_locale": "en",

//in _locales/en/messages.json:
{
  "appName": {
    "message": "My extension",
    "description": "The title of the application, displayed in the web store."
  },
  "appDesc": {
    "message": "This extension does something awesome.",
    "description":"The description of the application, displayed in the web store."
  }
}

//in _locales/en_GB/messages.json:
{
  "appName": {
    "message": "My Application"
  },
  "appDesc": {
    "message": "This application does something brilliant."
  }
}
```

If you add a locale later, you just need to add a `_locales/_locale_/messages.json` file for that
new locale. For example, if you add support for French and Arabic, you'll need to add two files:
`_locales/fr/messages.json` and `_locales/ar/messages.json`. Each of those files can be a copy of
`_locales/en_GB/messages.json`, but with translated versions of the "message" values.

For more details, see the following examples and documentation.

- Example: [Minimal Localized Hosted extension][13]
  - [manifest.json][14]
  - [\_locales/en/messages.json][15]
  - [\_locales/de/messages.json][16]
- Examples: [Extensions that use i18n APIs][17]
- Extensions documentation: [Internationalization][i18n]
  - The [How extensions find strings][searching-messages] section shows how you can sometimes omit message strings.
    For example, if the extension's name isn't translated, you can leave it out for non-default locales.
  - The [How to set your browser's locale][set-browser-locale] section is helpful when you test your translations.

Once you've completed this step, upload your extension using the Developer Dashboard, as described in
[Publishing Your extension][publish].

### Detailed description {: #cws-description }

For each locale your extension supports, edit your extension's listing to provide a detailed description of your
extension.

First, get to your extension's Edit page, which you can do by going to the dashboard and clicking the
"Edit" link for the extension. As the following figure shows, if you support multiple locales a pull-down
list appears at the top of your extension's Edit page. Each item in the list corresponds to one of the
`_locales/_locale_` directories that you uploaded.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/MbFyk7NrqNRhTLkOeIMT.png",
       alt="screenshot of the locale pull-down", height="57", width="525" %}

Next, choose the locale that you want to edit. (Skip this if your extension supports only one locale.)

Now edit the detailed description, providing text for the currently selected locale (or for the
default locale, if you support just one).

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/vJ5OLO5OdFBcmV963q8e.jpg", 
       alt="screenshot of the Detailed Description section for an extension", height="258", width="527" %}

If you support multiple locales, repeat the previous two steps until you've provided a detailed
description for each supported locale.

### Screenshots {: #cws-screenshots}

As the [screenshot guidelines][screenshot-guidelines] say, you should provide screenshots for your extension. You can tailor
these screenshots for each locale.

To add a screenshot, click the **Choose File** button in the **Screenshots** section of the Edit
page.

If your extension supports multiple locales, then after you upload each screenshot, you can specify
whether it's for all locales or just for the one you're currently editing.

{% Img src="image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/TTqmjZAmXBuov9HRBISe.png", 
       alt="screenshot of screenshots with localization options", height="375", width="430" %}

To change the locale information for a screenshot, first use the pull-down list at the top of the
page to choose the locale where you want the screenshot to appear. (If you don't see the screenshot,
go to the locale that it's restricted to and click "Show this item in **all** locales".) Click the
thumbnail for the screenshot, so that it's displayed at full size above the thumbnails. Now you can
change the locale for the screenshot.

## Specifying where to publish your extension {: #regions}

By default, your extension is listed in all regions that can use the Chrome Web Store. If you don't want
your extension to be listed in a particular region, unselect that region from the following list in the
**Regions** section of the Edit page.

- Argentina
- Australia
- Austria
- Belgium
- Brazil
- Canada
- China
- Czech Republic
- Denmark
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Hong Kong
- India
- Indonesia
- Israel
- Italy
- Japan
- Mexico
- Netherlands
- New Zealand
- Norway
- Philippines
- Poland
- Portugal
- Russia
- Singapore
- Spain
- Sweden
- Switzerland
- United Kingdom
- United States

{% Aside %}
Unselecting a region prevents your extension from being listed in that region.
